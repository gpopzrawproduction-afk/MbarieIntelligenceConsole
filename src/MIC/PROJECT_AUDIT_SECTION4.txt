INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

EMAIL SYNCHRONIZATION:
- Currently uses simulated data instead of real IMAP/POP3 connections
- ExternalEmail and ExternalAttachment classes are mock implementations
- FetchExternalEmailsAsync method returns dummy data
- No actual email provider authentication or API calls
- Attachment processing is simulated rather than real file handling

AI INTEGRATION:
- AI analysis is rule-based rather than using real AI models
- ApplyAIAnalysisToEmailAsync uses basic keyword matching
- No actual AI service calls or API integrations
- Knowledge base indexing is simulated
- Chat service uses mock responses

DATABASE AND PERSISTENCE:
- Some repositories may not be fully implemented
- Demo data generation suggests real data population is incomplete
- Email sync operations are simulated rather than real implementations

UI COMPONENTS:
- Many converter classes have unimplemented ConvertBack methods
- Some ViewModels may lack proper error handling
- Data binding may fail in two-way scenarios due to unimplemented methods

CONFIGURATION:
- AI settings likely need real API endpoints and keys
- Email provider configurations are missing
- Security configurations may be incomplete
