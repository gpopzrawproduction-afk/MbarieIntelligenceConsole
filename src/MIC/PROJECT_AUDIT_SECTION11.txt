SECTION 11: CONFIGURATION & SETTINGS ISSUES
═══════════

1. APPSETTINGS.JSON:
   - All sections properly structured: YES - Well-organized configuration sections
   - Environment-specific files present: YES - Development and Production files exist
   - Secrets removed: MOSTLY - API keys are empty strings but present in config
   - Default values appropriate: YES - Sensible defaults provided
   - Complete current appsettings.json: Shown in file above with Database, ConnectionStrings, Logging, AI, and JwtSettings sections

2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - Required variables documented: NO - No clear documentation of required environment variables
   - Fallback values provided: YES - Configuration uses Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration with environment variable support
   - Validation on startup: PARTIAL - Some validation exists but could be more comprehensive
   - Required environment variables: AI API keys, JWT secret, potentially database connection strings

3. CONNECTION STRINGS:
   - Properly formatted: YES - Standard ADO.NET connection string format
   - Secure: ADEQUATE - Obfuscation implemented in code but not in config
   - Environment-specific: YES - Separate connection strings for different environments

SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION & SETTINGS ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. SECURITY CONCERNS:
   - Empty API keys in configuration files (AI:OpenAI:ApiKey, AI:AzureOpenAI:ApiKey)
   - JWT SecretKey is empty in appsettings - needs to be set in environment
   - Connection strings point to local database files which may be insecure
   - Demo credentials in DbInitializer pose security risk if config enables seeding

2. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:
   - Missing environment-specific overrides for production
   - No configuration validation at startup
   - Hardcoded values mixed with configurable options
   - No centralized configuration management strategy

3. DEFAULT VALUES:
   - Some potentially unsafe defaults (DeleteDatabaseOnStartup=true in Development)
   - JWT expiration at 8 hours may be too long for some security requirements
   - AI features enabled by default may consume resources unnecessarily

4. MISSING CONFIGURATIONS:
   - No SMTP settings for email notifications
   - No external service endpoints configured
   - No rate limiting or security headers configured
   - No backup/restore configuration settings

5. CONFIGURATION CONSISTENCY:
   - Database settings split between Database section and ConnectionStrings
   - Some redundant configuration values
   - Inconsistent naming patterns in some sections

6. ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT:
   - Environment-specific settings could be better organized
   - No clear guidance on production deployment configuration
   - Missing configuration for different deployment scenarios

7. SENSITIVE DATA:
   - API keys should be loaded from secure vault rather than config files
   - JWT secret should be managed through secure means
   - Database credentials for production not addressed

8. FEATURE FLAGS:
   - AI features have good feature flagging
   - Email intelligence disabled by default (good security practice)
   - Some features may need more granular control

9. LOGGING CONFIGURATION:
   - Adequate logging levels set
   - Could benefit from structured logging configuration
   - No log retention or rotation settings

10. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
    - Configuration structure appears maintainable
    - Versioning strategy for configuration changes not evident
    - Migration path for configuration updates not defined
