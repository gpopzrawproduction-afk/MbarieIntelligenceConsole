SECTION 6: UI/UX ISSUES
═════════════

1. XAML ISSUES:
   - MainWindow.axaml has complex nested Grid structures that could affect performance
   - Binding errors possible in StatCard.axaml with named controls that expect specific properties
   - Missing DataContext validation in some user controls
   - XAML formatting is clean and well-structured overall
   - Design-time data contexts properly implemented for preview

2. VIEWMODEL ISSUES:
   - ChatViewModel has proper INotifyPropertyChanged implementation via ReactiveUI
   - Commands properly implemented with can-execute logic
   - Memory leaks possible from static service provider access in ChatViewModel
   - User session retrieval could be improved with proper error handling
   - ObservableCollections properly used throughout

3. NAVIGATION ISSUES:
   - Main window uses ContentControl with DataTemplates for view switching
   - Navigation commands properly implemented in MainWindowViewModel
   - Back navigation not implemented in the current design
   - State preservation unclear when switching between views
   - No loading states shown during navigation

4. DATA DISPLAY ISSUES:
   - Empty states handled: MINIMAL - mostly relies on default data
   - Loading states: PARTIAL - some loading indicators present
   - Error states: MINIMAL - basic error handling in chat
   - Null data handling: GOOD - proper null checking in many places
   - Data display issues: Some hardcoded limits (e.g., take(3) for knowledge results)

5. VISUAL QUALITY:
   - Consistent styling with holographic/glass morphism design
   - Proper color harmony with neon accent colors
   - Typography hierarchy clear with different font weights and sizes
   - Icons present and appropriate for context
   - Visual quality rating: 8/10 - modern, professional design
   - Minor issue: Excessive use of shadows might impact performance

6. RESPONSIVE LAYOUT:
   - Fixed minimum window size (MinWidth="1200" MinHeight="700")
   - Design widths specified for preview (d:DesignWidth="1400" d:DesignHeight="900")
   - No responsive adaptations for different screen sizes
   - Layout assumes desktop usage primarily
   - Responsive layout issues: Window sizing inflexible for different displays

SPECIFIC UI/UX ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. PERFORMANCE CONCERNS:
   - MainWindow.axaml uses multiple BoxShadow effects which can impact rendering performance
   - Complex nested controls in StatCard.axaml may affect rendering speed
   - No virtualization implemented for lists (could be problematic with large datasets)

2. ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES:
   - No explicit accessibility properties set (automation names, etc.)
   - Color contrast may be insufficient in some areas
   - Keyboard navigation may be limited beyond basic tab order
   - Screen reader support not explicitly implemented

3. USER EXPERIENCE:
   - Welcome message in ChatViewModel is personalized but could be more engaging
   - Loading indicators present during AI processing
   - Error messages are user-friendly
   - Suggested questions help guide user interaction
   - Command palette accessible via Ctrl+K for power users

4. CONSISTENCY:
   - Styling is very consistent across the application
   - Design system with BrandColors and Typography classes
   - Control templates consistent (StatCard, ToastContainer, etc.)
   - Theme support with light/dark themes implemented

5. DATA VISUALIZATION:
   - Charts implemented using LiveCharts library
   - Dashboard shows multiple metrics with visual indicators
   - Trend indicators with arrows and colors
   - Real-time updates for metrics and alerts

6. INTERACTION DESIGN:
   - Reactive commands properly implemented
   - Loading states during async operations
   - Visual feedback for user actions
   - Keyboard shortcuts available (Ctrl+K for command palette)

7. MOBILE READINESS:
   - Application designed primarily for desktop
   - Fixed minimum dimensions make mobile adaptation difficult
   - Touch interactions not optimized
   - No responsive layout for different screen sizes

8. DEMO READINESS SPECIFIC:
   - Visual appeal is high with modern glass morphism design
   - Professional appearance with consistent styling
   - Good use of animations and transitions
   - Dashboard provides comprehensive overview of system state
