═════════════

KEY FILES IDENTIFIED WITH ISSUES:

FILE: MIC.Core.Intelligence/Class1.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: ~80 lines
STATUS: Complete (but misnamed - should be renamed from Class1.cs)
ISSUES: Misleading filename Class1.cs for actual implementation, should be renamed to IntelligenceProcessor.cs
DEPENDENCIES: Used by MIC.Core.Intelligence project

FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.AI/Class1.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: 5 lines
STATUS: Stub (empty class)
ISSUES: Placeholder file with no implementation, violates naming conventions
DEPENDENCIES: None

FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Data/Class1.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: 5 lines
STATUS: Stub (empty class)
ISSUES: Placeholder file with no implementation, violates naming conventions
DEPENDENCIES: None

FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Identity/Class1.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: ~100 lines
STATUS: Complete (actual implementation, not a stub)
ISSUES: Misleading filename Class1.cs for actual implementation, should be renamed to PasswordHasher.cs
DEPENDENCIES: Implements IPasswordHasher interface

FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Monitoring/Class1.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: ~150 lines
STATUS: Complete (actual implementation, not a stub)
ISSUES: Misleading filename Class1.cs for actual implementation, should be renamed to MonitoringService.cs
DEPENDENCIES: Implements monitoring functionality

FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Converters/AlertConverters.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: ~70 lines
STATUS: Problematic (contains 3 NotImplementedException instances)
ISSUES: ConvertBack methods not implemented, will cause runtime errors when used in two-way binding
DEPENDENCIES: Used by UI for alert status/color conversion

FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Converters/BoolConverters.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: ~60 lines
STATUS: Problematic (contains 3 NotImplementedException instances)
ISSUES: ConvertBack methods not implemented, will cause runtime errors when used in two-way binding
DEPENDENCIES: Used by UI for boolean conversions

FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Converters/MetricConverters.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: ~30 lines
STATUS: Problematic (contains 1 NotImplementedException instance)
ISSUES: ConvertBack method not implemented, will cause runtime errors when used in two-way binding
DEPENDENCIES: Used by UI for metric conversions

FILE: MIC.Core.Domain/Entities/EmailAccount.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: Unknown
STATUS: Unknown
ISSUES: Need to check for completeness
DEPENDENCIES: Part of domain model

FILE: MIC.Core.Domain/Entities/EmailMessage.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: Unknown
STATUS: Unknown
ISSUES: Need to check for completeness
DEPENDENCIES: Part of domain model

FILE: MIC.Core.Domain/Entities/EmailAttachment.cs
TYPE: .cs
SIZE: Unknown
STATUS: Unknown
ISSUES: Need to check for completeness
DEPENDENCIES: Part of domain model

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
- Multiple "Class1.cs" files that appear to be placeholders but some contain real implementations
- All ValueConverter classes have unimplemented ConvertBack methods which will cause issues in two-way bindings
- Need to verify all entity classes for completeness
- Need to check all service implementations for completeness
