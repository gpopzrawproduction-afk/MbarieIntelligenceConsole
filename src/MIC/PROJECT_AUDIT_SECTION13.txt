SECTION 13: CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE FIX
═════════════

SHOWSTOPPERS (Must fix before demo):

1. [CRITICAL SECURITY] Hardcoded admin credentials in DbInitializer
   FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Data/Persistence/DbInitializer.cs
   LINE: ~198-206 (admin / Admin@123 credentials)
   ISSUE: Demo credentials pose immediate security risk during presentation
   RISK: Credentials could be exposed during live demo

2. [CRITICAL RUNTIME] NotImplementedException in all ValueConverter classes
   FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Converters/AlertConverters.cs
   LINE: Multiple ConvertBack methods throw NotImplementedException
   ISSUE: Will cause crashes during two-way binding scenarios
   RISK: Application crash during demo if user interacts with bindings

3. [CRITICAL RUNTIME] Same issue in BoolConverters
   FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Converters/BoolConverters.cs
   LINE: Multiple ConvertBack methods throw NotImplementedException
   ISSUE: Will cause crashes during two-way binding scenarios
   RISK: Application crash during demo

4. [CRITICAL RUNTIME] Same issue in MetricConverters
   FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Converters/MetricConverters.cs
   LINE: ConvertBack method throws NotImplementedException
   ISSUE: Will cause crashes during two-way binding scenarios
   RISK: Application crash during demo

5. [CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY] AI features require configuration to work
   FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.AI/Services/ChatService.cs
   LINE: ~52-54 (API key validation)
   ISSUE: AI chat will not function without proper API configuration
   RISK: Demo fails to showcase AI capabilities

HIGH PRIORITY (Should fix before demo):

6. [SECURITY] Weak password requirements in authentication
   FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Identity/AuthenticationService.cs
   ISSUE: Only basic validation, no strength requirements
   RISK: Security vulnerability in production

7. [RUNTIME] Email sync is simulated rather than real implementation
   FILE: MIC.Core.Intelligence/EmailSyncService.cs
   ISSUE: Uses mock data instead of actual email provider integration
   RISK: Demo shows fake data instead of real functionality

8. [PERFORMANCE] Complex XAML effects may impact rendering
   FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Views/MainWindow.axaml
   ISSUE: Multiple BoxShadow effects throughout UI
   RISK: Poor performance during demo

9. [MEMORY] Unlimited notification accumulation
   FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Services/NotificationService.cs
   ISSUE: ObservableCollection never cleared, grows indefinitely
   RISK: Memory issues during extended demo

10. [ARCHITECTURE] Async void in UI event handlers
    FILE: MIC.Desktop.Avalonia/Views/MainWindow.axaml.cs
    ISSUE: async void HandleAction method
    RISK: Unhandled exceptions can crash application

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix if time permits):

11. [DATA] GetAccountsNeedingSyncAsync loads all accounts into memory
    FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Data/Repositories/EmailRepository.cs
    ISSUE: Inefficient for SQLite with many accounts
    RISK: Performance degradation with larger datasets

12. [MEMORY] Chat conversation history not expired
    FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.AI/Services/ChatService.cs
    ISSUE: Conversations stored permanently without cleanup
    RISK: Memory growth over time

13. [CONFIGURATION] JWT token expiration too long
    FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Identity/JwtTokenService.cs
    ISSUE: 8-hour token lifetime may be excessive
    RISK: Security concern in production

14. [ERROR HANDLING] Reflection usage in MetricDataGenerator
    FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Data/Services/MetricDataGenerator.cs
    ISSUE: Uses reflection to set private properties
    RISK: Performance impact and potential errors

15. [INPUT VALIDATION] Basic email validation only
    FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.Identity/AuthenticationService.cs
    ISSUE: Only checks for '@' symbol in email validation
    RISK: Could accept invalid email addresses

LOW PRIORITY (Technical debt for later):

16. [MAINTAINABILITY] Placeholder "Class1.cs" files
    FILE: MIC.Infrastructure.AI/Class1.cs, MIC.Infrastructure.Data/Class1.cs
    ISSUE: Empty placeholder files with generic names
    RISK: Code quality and confusion for maintainers

17. [TESTING] No meaningful tests implemented
    FILE: All test projects (MIC.Tests.*)
    ISSUE: Only stub test files with no actual tests
    RISK: No quality assurance for future changes

18. [DOCUMENTATION] Limited inline documentation
    FILE: Various files throughout solution
    ISSUE: Insufficient comments for complex logic
    RISK: Maintenance difficulty

19. [CONFIGURATION] Missing environment-specific configs
    FILE: appsettings.*.json files
    ISSUE: No clear production deployment guidance
    RISK: Deployment challenges

20. [PERFORMANCE] No data virtualization for large lists
    FILE: Various ViewModel files with ObservableCollections
    ISSUE: No virtualization for potentially large datasets
    RISK: Performance with large data volumes
